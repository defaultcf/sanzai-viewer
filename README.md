=====

You should not sanzai...


## Usage
Input repo path (example: "toshihitokon/sanzai"), then visualize sanzai by parsing csv.


## Create own sanzai repo
You can create sanzai repo, and visualize your sanzai using sanzai viewer.

1. Create repo. You can set name what you want.
2. Create csv file in the repo. You can set name what you want, but extension have to be ".csv". And its layout have to be like below.

```
決済日, 内容, 散財額, 支払い方法, 分類
6/16, プレミアム牛めし, 380, suica, 食費
6/17, Aqours3rdガチャ, 1000, 現金, Aqours3rd
```

Example is [here](https://github.com/ToshihitoKon/sanzai/blob/master/OSSummit2018.csv).


That's all. Enjoy sanzai with moderation.
